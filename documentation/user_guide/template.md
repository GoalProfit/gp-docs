## **When to use**


Pricing solutions enable retailers to maximize GMROI (Gross Margin Return on Investment) by setting optimal initial prices, promotions, and markdowns.

Using pricing optimization retailers get:

- Integrating planning with pricing enables a retailer to create an optimal product journey.
- Retail AI uses limitations, goals, and sales history to minimize cost and maximize profit. 

The system, developed by GoalProfit, predicts at what price items are most profitable to sell and boosts sales by analyzing demand elasticity. A low-code platform, it flexibly adjusts to users without long development cycles. To do this, the model focuses on the main demand drivers: seasonality, promotional activity, inventory levels, price elasticity of demand, and assortment rotation. The system considers the costs of store re-evaluation, more than 40 pricing rules, and competitor data.
