# What is Price Optimization?

Digital Wave is a suite of SaaS applications for category managers, pricing analysts, trade marketing, and merchandising executives. With Dynamic and Rules-Based Pricing, Digital Wave automates your re-pricing and executes the pricing strategy. By giving real-time, intra-day, and online pricing recommendations at scale and speed, Digital Wave will help you maintain a competitive position, protect your margin, and adhere to product relationships and other pricing policies.

Dynamic pricing is a pricing strategy where fixed prices are replaced with variable prices. Typically, a business will set prices at a certain amount when going into a specific season. In contrast, dynamic pricing will involve multiple price changes within a day.

The system, developed by Digital Wave, predicts at what price items are most profitable to sell and boosts sales by analyzing demand elasticity. A low-code platform, it flexibly adjusts to users without long development cycles. To do this, the model focuses on the main demand drivers: seasonality, promotional activity, inventory levels, price elasticity of demand, and assortment rotation. The system considers the costs of store re-evaluation, more than 40 pricing rules, and competitor data.

## **Features**

The following key features help you develop the pricing strategy and achieve desired KPIs: 

**Digital Wave Price Management Software-as-a-Service**

Price management software is a type of tool that businesses can use to manage the prices of their products or services. This type of software can help businesses to set and maintain competitive prices, while also taking into account factors such as the cost of goods sold, market demand, and competitors' prices. Some features of price management software include the ability to track and analyze market data, set pricing rules and strategies, and automate the process of updating prices. Control your pricing and maximize profitability by using an advanced pricing platform that provide you with very accurate pricing recommendations that are geared towards your sales and revenue targets.

**Digital Wave Price Optimization Software-as-a-Service**

The forecast module in price optimization uses data analysis and algorithms to predict future market conditions and consumer behavior. This information is used to identify the prices that will maximize a company's profitability. Factors such as promotional activity, inventory levels, price elasticity of demand, and assortment rotation are taken into account when making price recommendations.

Using dynamic pricing to set fair and competitive prices, businesses can improve their customers' satisfaction and build stronger relationships with them. By regularly adjusting their prices based on market conditions and competitors' prices, dynamic pricing provides valuable insights into market trends and consumer behavior, which can help businesses make more informed decisions about their pricing strategies.

**Digital Wave Markdown Optimization Software-as-a-Service**

Markdowns are used to temporarily increase demand for low-demand products, ideally long enough to sell through all stock. Markdowns are caused by excess inventory at the end of a selling season. Since most markdowns are not planned for in advance (or at least accounted for in the pre-season planning stages), they frequently drain profits considerably more than they have to.

Most retailers would rather have a little bit of extra inventory left over than not enough (which would signify that they lost sales). And cutting prices is the only way to clear this leftover inventory at the end of a season or of a product’s lifecycle.

Although markdowns can have a similar sales uplift to a promotion, the purpose and approach of these two pricing events are very different. Promotional discounts are temporary and can have goals beyond sales uplifts, such as increased in-store traffic, or increased familiarity with new products. Markdowns, however, have a single goal: get rid of end-of-life inventory by end-of-season, while maximizing gross margins.

Determining a retail markdown strategy without considering a product’s entire price strategy throughout its life cycle will be ineffective. An optimal markdown strategy should be a part of a larger pricing strategy which begins with initial pricing and accounts for all promotional events.
