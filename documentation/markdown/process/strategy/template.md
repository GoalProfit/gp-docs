# Create Strategies


Strategies for price optimization can be formed in three ways:

-   Create a new strategy and add price rules,

-   Export/import rules to Excel,

-   See existing configuration in the Strategies tab

After defining the scope - a list of items whose price will be
optimized - by selecting the report or creating a new one; you can
proceed to set the price rules for those items to be optimized.

The number of rules, their scope & custom parameters can be saved as a
strategy configuration.

In the Strategies Tab, select "*Create a new entry"* in the field
"*Config name*" and type the name of the new strategy.

By clicking "*Show shared config*", you will be able to view other
strategies done by other users if they have checked the box "*Share this
config*" when they save the settings.
