# GoalProfit Markdown Optimization


Markdowns are used to temporarily increase demand for low-demand products, ideally long enough to sell through all stock. Markdowns are caused by excess inventory at the end of a selling season. Since most markdowns are not planned for in advance (or at least accounted for in the pre-season planning stages), they frequently drain profits considerably more than they have to.

Most retailers would rather have a little bit of extra inventory left over than not enough (which would signify that they lost sales). And cutting prices is the only way to clear this leftover inventory at the end of a season or of a product’s lifecycle. Markdown Optimization allows you to schedule price reductions over a time interval to help you manage products out of assortments gracefully and cost-effectively.

Our platform helps you determine a retail markdown strategy that is integrated into your larger pricing strategy, ensuring that you consider a product's entire price strategy throughout its life cycle. This includes initial pricing and all promotional events, ensuring that your markdown strategy is effective and aligned with your overall financial goals.


# Getting Started

The markdown optimization process begins with the creation of a markdown report and the configuration of a markdown strategy. Setting the scope and rules for the optimization process is part of this. After you've established the strategy, you may optimize the markdown pricing by selecting the scope (such as categories or stores) and the items with markdown recommendations. Time sentsitive recommenndations (for the current week) will be higlighted separately.

After you've decided which products to optimize, you may analyze the recommendations to double-check the forecasts and compare different optimization runs. You may also review the analysis tab for each individual item and, if required, override the suggestions. Finally, you may approve the markdown recommendations and, if necessary, mass approve them.
