# Streams

[Admin UI](/admin#/dataset/streams)

Stream is physical structured data that is loaded externally into the system. The platform always saves in its original form all the data that enters it. The data format can be anything as long as it can be converted to a column type.
The Search field is used to filter streams by name mask. Supports regular expressions.
