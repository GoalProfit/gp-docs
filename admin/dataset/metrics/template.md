#### Metrics

Metric is a named computable entity. Unlike attributes, metrics cannot be used in filters unless to filter out resulting rows in a report. In addition to computation, part metric defines visual representation, including value format and cell, row, and column styles. Metric can be editable. When you build a report, the attributes are evaluated in the _cols_ parameter.
