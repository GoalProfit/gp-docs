* Fast and reliable data integration

## Vertical integration

Тhe platform provides a vertically and seamlessly integrated technology stack, including data storage, data transformation, data integration, analytics components, business application runtime, and an interactive development environment.

## Vertical and horizontal scalability

Тhe platform can efficiently utilize available hardware resources in a single server and cluster configurations with near-linear scalability.

## Reliability and fault tolerance

Тhe platform is designed to operate in high availability mode and resist catastrophic hardware failures.

## Data multi-versioning and no data locks

Тhe platform embraces a functional design paradigm leveraging immutability, persistent data structures, and control of side effects. It eliminates data locks while querying and modifying big data sets at the same time.

## Embedded interactive development environment

Тhe platform provides an embedded interactive development environment (IDE). The IDE embraces live editing and WYSIWYG approaches to enable the rapid development of data-rich and analytics-powered business applications.

## Comprehensive and expandable building blocks

Тhe platform has a complete set of components and building blocks to construct sophisticated business applications. 

## Fast analytics

Тhe platform is built around a state-of-the-art analytical engine capable of processing billions of data points per second.

## Fast and reliable data integration

Тhe platform provides managed declarative ELT pipeline that ensures the correctness of all derived data artifacts.
