# Fundamental Principles

GoalProfit platform is built on the following fundamental principles:

* Vertical integration
* Vertical and horizontal scalability
* Reliability and fault tolerance
* Data multi-versioning and no data locks
* Embedded interactive development environment
* Comprehensive and expandable set of building blocks
* Fast analytics
* Fast and reliable data integration

*Vertical integration* – the platform provides a vertically and seamlessly integrated technology stack, including data storage, data transformation, data integration, analytics components, business application runtime, and an interactive development environment.

*Vertical and horizontal scalability* – the platform can efficiently utilize available hardware resources in a single server and cluster configurations with near-linear scalability.

*Reliability and fault tolerance* – the platform is designed to operate in high availability mode and resist catastrophic hardware failures.

*Data multi-versioning and no data locks* – the platform embraces a functional design paradigm leveraging immutability, persistent data structures, and control of side effects. It eliminates data locks while querying and modifying big data sets at the same time.

*Embedded interactive development environment* – the platform provides an embedded interactive development environment (IDE). The IDE embraces live editing and WYSIWYG approaches to enable the rapid development of data-rich and analytics-powered business applications.

*Comprehensive and expandable building blocks* – the platform has a complete set of components and building blocks to construct sophisticated business applications. 

*Fast analytics* – the platform is built around a state-of-the-art analytical engine capable of processing billions of data points per second.

*Fast and reliable data integration* – the platform provides managed declarative ELT pipeline that ensures the correctness of all derived data artifacts.
