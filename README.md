# User Administration Guide

The Administratin Guide provides conceptual information about the GoalProfit product. This book defines terminology and includes implementation scenarios.

## Overview

The system is designed to automate the pricing process, which includes the formation of recommendations based on price rules, competitor prices, forecasts and elasticity.
The system is a comprehensive solution based on a microservice architecture that allows you to generate recommendations at regular prices with a speed close to online. 
The system is built on the basis of the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process, which includes:

* extracting data from external sources - extract;
* loading them into the data warehouse - load;
* transformation and cleanup to fit the needs of the business model - transform.

## Navigating the interface

Basic interface - a web interface for users to work with the application. 
It is a set of pre-configured pages with static addresses and user-created pages. 
The root page for custom pages is the /pages page.
List of preconfigured pages:

* pages
* pages/config2
* admin
* users
* graphiQL

User-created pages are created blank by default. If, after creation, the content of the page is not edited, then it is not saved in the system.

## Additional services

###### Combined file collection service

###### File upload service via Drag&Drop
###### Service for unloading data from the system

## Pricing module

The pricing module is used to calculate price recommendations based on price rules and established optimization principles.
Price rules can be formed in a special interface from basic rules. 
The module accepts json files as input with the combined entity and additional parameters that are generated by the Retail microservice, such as price zones.
It analyzes the intersecting rules and breaks the data into independent blocks, on which the optimization module performs a parallel calculation. At the output, the optimization module returns csv files.
The input and output files of the optimization module are stored in the /gp/retail/cache folder. The user interface shows the proposed price and optimization curves (if the latter has been added).

## Forecast module

The forecasting module is used to predict various indicators: elasticity, demand (including seasonal demand), whether it is necessary to buy additional goods.
The output of the module can be used either for direct evaluation by the client or in an optimization process in the pricing module.
The module accepts historical data and a set of hyperparameters as input.
The general scheme of the module operation is presented below:

## Configuration & Settings

To implement the price recommendation process in the system, you need to take the following steps:

* to process and transform data to present them in the structure necessary for the system
* upload data to the system
* customize user interfaces
* set up the main entity for the pricing interface
* customize pricing module interface
* set up price rules
